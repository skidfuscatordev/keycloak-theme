# Keycloak Theme for Skidfuscator Stuff

This project uses [Keycloakify](https://keycloakify.dev) and uses [Keycloakify Starter](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-starter) as a base, and utilizes React.js. 

Only CSS is customized.

This is used to match the theme of [billing-frontend](https://github.com/skidfuscatordev/billing-frontend), which is built using the [Skeleton](https://skeleton.dev) UI framework. 

When building for production, ONLY use the standalone option (default) when invoking the `npx keycloakify` command.
